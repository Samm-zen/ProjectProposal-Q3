Detailed Methodology
The program is a Python command-line application that takes user input for bank balance, expenses, and savings goal. Expenses are stored as dictionaries, totals are calculated, and financial advice is generated based on the remaining balance.

Technologies Used (With Justification)
Python was chosen for its readability and efficiency, and GitHub was used for version control. A CLI was used to keep the project simple, relying only on built-in Python functionality.

Backend–Frontend Communication
The input() function acts as the frontend by receiving data, while functions process calculations as the backend. No external communication is required since the program runs locally.

Key Design Decisions and Trade-offs
Dictionaries and functions were used for structured, maintainable code. The CLI and lack of permanent data storage reduce complexity, though future updates may include databases.

Programming and Computing Ethics
User privacy is protected, and all code is original with proper citations. The interface and advice system are simple, accessible, and neutral, following ethical programming principles.
